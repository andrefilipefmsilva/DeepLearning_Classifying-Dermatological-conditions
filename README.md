# Classification of Dermatological skin condition images utilizing Neural Networks


**Work developed as part of the Deep Learning course at Nova IMS**

Several deep neural network architechtures were developed: custom-built ones, ResNet, DenseNet, and Multi-Input CNN.

Final Report is not very complete due to time constraints but it should be enough guidance to understand the code.

Main Tools: Python, Tensorflow
